## Abstract

The integration of ML and IoT offers a proactive approach to heart disease prediction. This study employs algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to analyze patient data. IoT-based real-time monitoring enhances the accuracy of predictions and facilitates timely medical interventions.

## Introduction

Traditional diagnostic methods for heart disease can be both inaccurate and costly. Machine Learning provides improved prediction accuracy using fewer attributes, while IoT enables continuous health monitoring. The combination of these technologies transforms healthcare from reactive to proactive, allowing for early detection and management of heart conditions.
